Geeks Dilemma
=============

This is a fairly silly project. On the face of it, it is designed 
to allow a group of people to arrange a night out and know that enough
poeple that they get along with will be going without having to hurt 
anyone's feelings. This is actually something that I think we need but
I doubt it will ever see the light of day.

The *real* reason I am writing this is just to use it as a non-trivial 
problem on which to try out technologies I'm interested in learning.

As such it currently uses:

* RavenDB
* Asp.Net MVC 4
* Some angular.js 
* Twitter bootstrap
* HTML5 Boilerplate
* A little bit of pjax
* OpenAuth / Social integrations
* A bit of google maps

I imagine I will refactor a number of times throughout its life to 
different technologies as they take my fancy.
